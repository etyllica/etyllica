	 * Worst Case:

	 * Which is just way too large.  Dividing by a factor is still grossly over estimated so
	 * I opted to do an estimate on the test results found in the Sandbox application.
	 * <p>
	 * Test Results:
	 * <pre>
	 * +----------+------------+-----------------+-----------------+
	 * | Test     | Body Count | Collision Pairs | Collisions/Body |
	 * +----------+------------+-----------------+-----------------+
	 * | Bucket   |        200 |            ~500 |             2.5 |
	 * | Funnel   |        200 |            ~400 |             2.0 |
	 * | Parallel |        300 |             600 |             2.0 |
	 * +----------+------------+-----------------+-----------------+</pre>
	 * Therefore a good estimate could be 4 collisions per body.
	 * <p>
	 * Unfortunately a better estimate would be to also count the number of fixtures among all bodies since
	 * each fixture on each body could be in contact with one other fixture of another body.
	 * <p>
	 * This field may not exist (may get deprecated) in future versions if a better estimate technique is found.
