/**
 * Sub package of the Collision package handling contact manifold generation.
 * <p>
 * Once a penetration vector and depth have been found between two 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.Collidable}s, the next step is to find where the collision occurred.
 * <p>
 * A contact {@link org.dyn4j.collision.manifold.Manifold} is an object representing the surface 
 * where the two {@link org.dyn4j.collision.Collidable}s are colliding.
 * <p>
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.manifold.Manifold}s have been designed to represent two types of 
 * surfaces: edge and point.
 * <p>
 * A {@link org.dyn4j.collision.manifold.Manifold} contains a number of 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.manifold.ManifoldPoint}s who represent the surface. For 2D this will 
 * either be 1 or 2 points.
 * <p>
 * A {@link org.dyn4j.collision.manifold.ManifoldSolver} is used to obtain a collision 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.manifold.Manifold} from a 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.Penetration} object.
 * <p>
 * Only one implementation of the {@link org.dyn4j.collision.manifold.ManifoldSolver} is provided: 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.manifold.ClippingManifoldSolver}.
 * @author William Bittle
 * @version 2.2.2
 * @since 1.0.0
