/**
 * Sub package of the Collision package handling narrow-phase collision detection.
 * <p>
 * Narrow-phase collision detection is used to determine if two {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Convex} 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Shape}s penetrate, and if so, compute the vector of minimum magnitude 
 * able to push the {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Convex} {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Shape}s out 
 * of penetration.
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.NarrowphaseDetector}s can only perform on 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Convex} {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Shape}s.  This allows for fast 
 * and simple algorithms.
 * <p>
 * Even though the {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.NarrowphaseDetector}s are fast, performance 
 * can be improved substantially if a {@link org.dyn4j.collision.broadphase.BroadphaseDetector} is 
 * used to eliminate obvious non-penetrating pairs.
 * <p>
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.NarrowphaseDetector}s return 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.Penetration} objects representing the vector of minimum 
 * magnitude able to push the {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Convex} 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Shape}s out of penetration.
 * <p>
 * There are two {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.NarrowphaseDetector} implementations provided: 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.Sat} and {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.Gjk}.
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.Gjk} 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.NarrowphaseDetector} also has another method to return 
 * the {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.Separation} between to 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Convex} {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Shape}s.  The 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.Separation} represents the vector of minimum distance from 
 * one {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Convex} {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Shape} to the other.
