/**
 * Represents a broad-phase collision detection algorithm.
 * <p>
 * A {@link BroadphaseDetector} should quickly determine the pairs of {@link Collidable}s that 
 * possibly intersect.  These algorithms are used to filter out collision pairs in the interest 
 * of sending less pairs to the {@link NarrowphaseDetector}.
 * <p>
 * {@link BroadphaseDetector}s require that the collidables are updated via the {@link #update(Collidable)}
 * method when the collidables move, rotate, or are changed in anyway that changes their AABB.
 * <p>
 * {@link BroadphaseDetector}s use a expansion value to expand the AABB of a collidable.  The {@link #getAABB(Collidable)}
 * returns the expanded {@link AABB}.  This expansion is used to reduce the number of updates to the
 * broadphase.  See the {@link #setAABBExpansion(double)} for more details on this value.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #detect()}, {@link #detect(AABB)}, {@link #raycast(Ray, double)} methods use the current state of
 * all the collidables that have been added.  Make sure that all changes have been reflected to the broadphase
 * using the {@link #update(Collidable)} method before calling these methods.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #detect(Collidable, Collidable)} and {@link #detect(Convex, Transform, Convex, Transform)} methods do not
 * use the current state of the broadphase.
