/**
 * This package contains algorithms to decompose polygons into 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Convex} pieces.
 * <p>
 * Three implementations of the {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.decompose.Decomposer} 
 * interface are provided: {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.decompose.Bayazit}, 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.decompose.EarClipping}, and 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.decompose.SweepLine}.
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.decompose.Bayazit} algorithm is O(nr) and finds a non-optimal 
 * convex decomposition.
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.decompose.EarClipping} algorithm is O(n<sup>2</sup>) and finds 
 * a valid triangulation, then uses the Hertel-Mehlhorn algorithm to combine triangles into convex pieces.  
 * This is also an non-optimal decomposition.
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.decompose.SweepLine} algorithm is O(n log n) and, like 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.decompose.EarClipping}, finds a valid triangulation,
 * then uses the Hertel-Mehlhorn algorithm to combine triangles into convex pieces.  This is also a
 * non-optimal decomposition.
 * <p>
 * In general the algorithms will generate different decompositions.  If used for pre-processing just
 * choose the best result, for runtime generation, the {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.decompose.Bayazit} 
 * may be slower but will generally produce a better decomposition.
 * <p>
 * A "better" decomposition is one that contains fewer convex pieces and the convex pieces that are created
 * are of better quality for simulation.
