 * Package containing classes to detect collisions between 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Convex} {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Shape}s.
 * <p>
 * Collision detection can be an expensive process.  To avoid unnecessary processing
 * a two phase approach to collision detection is used.  First a inaccurate, yet
 * conservative, algorithm is used to detect possible collision pairs.  This process is
 * called the broad-phase.  Next, after obtaining all the possible collision pairs, each
 * pair is tested using an accurate algorithm.  This is called the narrow-phase.
 * <p>
 * <b>Broad-phase</b>
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.dyn4j.collision.broadphase.BroadphaseDetector}s will determine whether 
 * two {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Convex} {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Shape}s can possibly 
 * penetrate, returning only valid {@link org.dyn4j.collision.broadphase.BroadphasePair}s, which 
 * should then be sent to a {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.NarrowphaseDetector}.
 * <p>
 * <b>Narrow-phase</b>
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.NarrowphaseDetector}s will determine whether two 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Convex} {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Shape}s penetrate and 
 * return a {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.Penetration}.
 * <p>
 * A {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.Penetration} object represents the minimum distance 
 * along some vector required to push the {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Shape}s out of the penetration.
 * <p>
 * <b>Manifold Generation</b>
 * <p>
 * Once a {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.Penetration} object is obtained, it should be passed
 * to a {@link org.dyn4j.collision.manifold.ManifoldSolver}.  A 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.manifold.ManifoldSolver} will use the 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.narrowphase.Penetration} object and the given 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Convex} {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Shape}s to create a collision 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.manifold.Manifold}.
 * <p>
 * A collision {@link org.dyn4j.collision.manifold.Manifold} represents the collision points between 
 * the two {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Convex} {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Shape}s.
