/**
 * Represents a {@link Bounds} object that is rectangular.
 * <p>
 * This class performs AABB collision detection to determine if the given {@link Collidable}
 * is inside or outside the bounds.
 * <p>
 * If the {@link Collidable} and the {@link Bounds} AABBs are overlapping, then the {@link Collidable}
 * is considered to be inside, if they are not overlapping, the {@link Collidable} is considered
 * outside.
 * <p>
 * Since this class is {@link Transformable}, the bounds can be rotated.  Detection of a shape outside
 * the bounds is done by testing the AABB of the shape and the AABB of the rotated bounds.
 * <p>
 * This class has been replaced by the {@link AxisAlignedBounds} class because of confusion in its detection
 * method.  The {@link AxisAlignedBounds} class better represents the intention of this class.
 * @author William Bittle
 * @version 3.1.1
 * @since 1.0.0
 * @deprecated replaced with {@link AxisAlignedBounds} in 3.1.1
 * @see AxisAlignedBounds
