/**
 * Sub package of the Collision package handling broad-phase collision detection.
 * <p>
 * Currently there are three broadphase implementations:
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.broadphase.SapIncremental},
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.broadphase.SapBruteForce}, and
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.broadphase.DynamicAABBTree}.
 * <p>
 * A {@link org.dyn4j.collision.broadphase.BroadphaseDetector} should accept a list of 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.Collidable}s and return those pairs who may be penetrating in a
 * list of {@link org.dyn4j.collision.broadphase.BroadphasePair}s.
 * <p>
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.broadphase.BroadphaseDetector}s are not expected to be accurate, 
 * but are expected to be conservative.  Meaning, its acceptable for a 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.collision.broadphase.BroadphaseDetector} to return false positives.
 * <p>
 * Typical applications will want to use the {@link org.dyn4j.collision.broadphase.DynamicAABBTree}
 * class since it has double the performance than the other two in raycasting at minimal performance
 * decrease in general collision detection.  If raycasting is not a large portion of the application, then
 * use of {@link org.dyn4j.collision.broadphase.SapIncremental} is advised because of its performance
 * benefits when objects are moving either rarely or not at all.  Finally, if constant performance is required
 * use {@link org.dyn4j.collision.broadphase.SapBruteForce}.
 * @author William Bittle
 * @version 3.0.0
 * @since 1.0.0
